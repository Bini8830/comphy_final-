#Reason
#1 
#Thorough Understanding of the Topic:
#The report demonstrates a deep understanding of both numerical methods 
#and machine learning techniques for time series prediction.
#The clear comparison between Euler's Method and RNN-based models (LSTM, GRU, and Bi-GRU)
#highlights my ability to integrate foundational knowledge with advanced methods.

#2
#Clear and Structured Presentation:
#The presentation is well-organized with clear sections, including Data Collection, Numerical Methods, Machine Learning Models, Code Implementation, and Results.
#The addition of a Discussion section on RNN structures further enriches the analysis.


#3
#Application Relevance
#By focusing on wave height prediction, an application with significant implications 
#for maritime safety and disaster preparedness, you demonstrated the real-world value of your work.
